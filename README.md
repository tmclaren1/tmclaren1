Hi, I'm Tommy McLaren.  I'm a graduate student in the Integrative Biology department at University of Colorado Denver.
I work on evolutionary ecology, particularly the coevoloved mutualism between Clark's nutcracker and whitebark pine.in
I’m interested in learning about data analysis and the languages of R and Python
I've been working on implementing hierarchical models to assess habitat use of Clark's nutcrackers in Yellowstone National Park
